Virtually eliminate the threat of brute-force attacks or password guessing by automatically regenerating your password every so often.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to set an interval, such as 30 days, where your admin password will be automatically regenerated and sent to the email address of your choice.

= Why do I need this plugin? =
You don't want your admin password to be hacked or guessed right? The best way to prevent this from happening is to change your password periodically. Sure, you can do this manually, but why not automatically? This plugin allows you to set when your password changes, as well as how strong or weak you want it to be. This is a install and forget type of plugin that will instantly secure your admin panel even more.

This plugin was built on WP 3.5, however older versions of WP should work fine. Test it out and let me know!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I do not receive the email when my password gets reset? =

This is rare, however if for some unforseen reason your server decides not to email you, you would simply login using Wordpress' "Forgot Password" feature.

= How often does this plugin reset my password? =

As often as you want. You can set it to reset every 5 days, 30 days, or even 90 days. This is completely up to you.
